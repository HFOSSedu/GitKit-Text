 	<p>
    You now have been assigned an <term>issue</term> to work on and yuu have created a <term>fork</term> of the <term>upstream</term> GitKit FarmData2 repository into your GitHub space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now to work on your issue you will need to setup your <term>local development environment</term>.  Your local development environment is where you will create your <term>clone</term> of the repository, where you will edit files, and where you will use `git` commands to add your changes to to your clone and <term>push</term> those changes to your <term>origin</term>.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Because individual computers can vary greatly, you will be using a <term>KitClient</term> as your local development environment. The KitClient is a local development environment that runs in the cloud and that you access through your web browser.  The KitClient has been created specifically for this text and includes a few features that are designed to help with the hands-on exercises.  Using the KitClient also ensures that everyone is working in the same environment, simplifying the instructions, and reducing the chances that things will go wrong.
