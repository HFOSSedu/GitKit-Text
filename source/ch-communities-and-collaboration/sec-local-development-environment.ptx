  <title>Your Development Environment</title>

  <introduction

    <p>
      You now have been assigned an <term>issue</term> to work on and yuu have created a <term>fork</term> of the <term>upstream</term> GitKit FarmData2 repository into your GitHub space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To work on your issue you will need to setup your <term>development environment</term>.  Your development environment is where you will create your <term>clone</term> of the repository, where you will edit files, and where you will use `git` commands to add your changes to to your clone and <term>push</term> those changes to your <term>origin</term>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Many FOSS contributors will setup the development environment on their personal machines. Because student machines vary greatly the GitKit provides a browser based development environment, called a <term>KitClient</term>. This development environment runs in the cloud and you will access it using your web browser.  This development environment includes standard development tools but also has a few features designed specifically to help you stay on track when completing the GitKit's hands-on exercises.
