  <introduction>
    <p>
      You will be using GitHub in many of the exercises in this text. In order to use GitHub it is necessary that you have an account, and a Personal Access Token.

  <subsection xml:id="topic-github-pat">
    GitHub Personal Access Token</title>
  When starting your development environment for the first time (in Section <xref ref="topic-development-environmen"/>) you will be asked to enter a <term>Personal Access Token (PAT)</term> from GitHub.
    A PAT is like a password but has some security benefits.
    In particular, you can have multiple different PATs.
    Each one can have different limits on what can be done with it and each one can be revoked individually without affecting the others.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Getting a Personal Access Token: </term>
  </p>
  <p>
    When interacting with GitHub using the git CLI (e.g.
    when pushing a branch), GitHub requires that you use a PAT for authentication instead of your password.
  </p>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-getting-pat" label="ex-getting-pat">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Follow GitHub's instructions for creating a (classic) personal access token: <url href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" visual="docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic">Creating a Personal Access Token (classic)</url>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When doing so be sure to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Choose “repo” for the “scopes and permissions.”
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Be sure to copy and paste your PAT somewhere safe – maybe e-mail it to yourself.
              You will not be able to retrieve it again after you leave the page.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: Typing or even copy and pasting your PAT every time it is needed can be a hassle.
        To help, the git CLI provides what is known as the <term>credential helper</term>.
        The git CLI in the KitClient has configured the credential helper so that your PAT will be stored when you enter it the first time.
        It will then be used automatically for future commands.
        If you are curious, you can learn more about the credential helper here: <url href="https://techexpertise.medium.com/storing-git-credentials-with-git-credential-helper-33d22a6b5ce7" visual="techexpertise.medium.com/storing-git-credentials-with-git-credential-helper-33d22a6b5ce7">Storing Git Credentials with Git Credential Helper</url>.
