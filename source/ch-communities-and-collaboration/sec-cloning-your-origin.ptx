  <title>Cloning Your Origin</title>

  <introduction>
 	  <p>
      The next step in the basic FOSS workflow is to ensure that you have a <term>clone</term> your <term>origin</term> repository in your development environment as shown in <xref ref="fig-basic-workflow-clone" />.  Having a clone of your origin in your development environment will allow you to edit the files in the repository to fix the issue that you have been assigned.
