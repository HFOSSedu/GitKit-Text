  <title>Basic FOSS Workflow Concepts</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that you have found an issue to work on, you will need to collaborate with the project community to fix that issue. Collaboration in FOSS communities follows patterns of behavior known as <term>workflows</term>. <xref ref="fig-basic-foss-workflow" /> shows a basic version of one FOSS workflow that is used by contributors working on FOSS projects.

          <description>Forking the main project repo creates your remote copy in your GitHub spacey.  Cloning your remote copy creates your local copy in your local development environment. Changes that you make to your local copy can be contributed to the main project by pushing them to your remote copy and creating a pull request.

      The exercises in this section will help to familiarize you with the terminology and the process of this basic FOSS workflow.

        <p>
          GitHub uses specific terminology to refer to the copies of the repository.  Match the GitHub terminology on the left with the repository in <xref ref="fig-basic-foss-workflow" /> to which it refers on the right.

          <xref ref="fig-basic-foss-workflow" /> illustrates a basic FOSS workflow similar to what is used in many FOSS projects.  This workflow has the following 5 steps: <term>Fork</term>, <term>Clone</term>, <term>Edit</term>, <term>Push</term>, and <term>Pull Request</term>. Match each term on the left with the appropriate description on the right.
