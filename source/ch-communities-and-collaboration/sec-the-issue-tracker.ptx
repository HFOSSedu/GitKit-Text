  <title>The Issue Tracker</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      FOSS projects often use an issue tracker to maintain a list of bugs to be fixed, features to be added and other tasks to be completed. Thus, the issue tracker is a good place to go in order to find something to work on in a FOSS project. The exercises in this section will guide you through interaction with the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker as shown in <xref ref="fig-issue-tracker"/>. By the end of the section you will have found an issue to work on. 
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Claiming an Issue</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Because projects often have many people working asynchronously many will have a process by which contributors can <term>claim</term> an issue that they are interested in working on and have that issue <term>assigned</term> to them in the issue tracker.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following exercises will guide you through the process of claiming an issue to work on in the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <exercises>

      <exercise

        >
        <statement>
          <p>
            Examine the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker. 
            How can you tell which issue have already been assigned?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <choices randomize="yes">
          <choice correct="yes">
            <statement>  
              The avatar of the assigned user appears to the right of the issue title.
            </statement>
          </choice>
          <choice correct="no">
            <statement>  
              The issue no longer appears in the issue tracker.
            </statement>
          </choice>
          <choice correct="no">
            <statement>  
              The username of assigned user appears next to the issue title.
            </statement>
          </choice>
          <choice correct="no">
            <statement>  
              The issue is moved to a separate list of assigned issues.
            </statement>
          </choice>
          <choice correct="no">
            <statement>  
              The issue tracker does not show any indication that an issue has been assigned.

          Look for some lines for issues that look different than the others and hover your mouse over the different parts.
        </hint>        
      </exercise>

      <p>
        In the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker, contributors interested in working on an issue can request that it be assigned to them by commenting on the issue with the exact message:
      </p>
        
      <p
        xml:id="topic-issue-claim-message">
        <c>I would like to work on this please!</c>
      </p>

      <p>
        The first person who comments on an unclaimed issue with this message will receive a response from the project maintainers. This messages will indicate that the issue has been assigned to them and the issue tracker will update to show this as you saw in <xref ref="ex-identifying-assigned-issues" />.
      </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             If you received a response telling you that you were not assigned the issue, someone else slipped a comment in just ahead of you and was assigned the issue.  If this happens, just try <xref ref="ex-claim-an-issue-b" /> again.
