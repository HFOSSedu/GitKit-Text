  <title>Your Development Environment</title>

  <introduction
    xml:id="topic-dev-env-intro">
    <p>
      You now have been assigned an <term>issue</term> to work on and you have created a <term>fork</term> of the <term>upstream</term> GitKit FarmData2 repository into your GitHub space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To work on your issue you will need to setup your <term>development environment</term>.  Your development environment is where you will create your <term>clone</term> of the repository, where you will edit files, and where you will use `git` commands to add your changes to to your clone and <term>push</term> those changes to your <term>origin</term>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Many FOSS contributors will setup the development environment on their personal machines. Because student machines vary greatly the GitKit provides a browser based development environment, called a <term>KitClient</term>. This development environment runs in the cloud and you will access it using your web browser.  This development environment includes standard development tools but also has a few features designed specifically to help you stay on track when completing the GitKit's hands-on exercises.

    <title>Configuring the Git Client</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your development environment includes a <term>Git client</term>. The Git client is the tool that you will use to interact with Git repositories, such as the GitKit FarmData2 repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of different Git clients. Some are graphical and some use a text interface. These exercises, introduce you to Git using its text-based <term>command line interface (CLI)</term>.  This is the most general way to interact with Git and will provide a conceptual foundation for using any other Git client that you might encounter.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Recall from class that Git repositories maintain a complete history of all changes, including who made each change.  To do this, Git needs to know a little bit of information about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git identifies the author of each change using two pieces of information: A name and an e-mail. For name, you might decide to your full name, or a nickname, or your GitHub username.  Just keep in mind that whatever name you use will be associated with all of the changes you make. For e-mail, you can again use any valid e-mail associated with you. 
          </p>
