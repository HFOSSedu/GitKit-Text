        <p>
          Use a text editor to modify the file you identified in <xref ref="ex-locate-claimed-issue-a" /> so that the issue you claimed has been fixed.

    <xref ref="fig-edit-local-files-on-feature-branch" />  illustrates the current situation where your <em>Local Files</em> have been modified. In <xref ref="fig-switch-to-feature-branch" /> the <em>Local Files</em> in your feature branch were drawn in green. This reflected that they were, at that time, an exact copy of the last commit on the main branch, which was also drawn in green.  Here <em>Local Files</em> are drawn in blue to indicate that they have been changed as compared to the final commit in the main branch, which is still green.

  <exercise xml:id="ex-verify-changes" label="ex-verify-changes">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The <c>git status</c> command can now be used to check that your changes have been made.
        Run the <c>git status</c> command now.
      </p>

    <task xml:id="ex-verify-changes-a" label="ex-verify-changes-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What two things does the output tell you about the file that you edited? If you see the message “nothing to commit, working tree clean,” it means that your edits in the previous exercise were not saved.
          <term>NOTE: may want to change this so that it asks which files are staged, untracked, etc.</term> Go back and save your edits and then issue the <c>git status</c> command again before describing the two things that the output tells you.

  <exercise xml:id="ex-verify-changes-with-diff" label="ex-verify-changes-with-diff">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The <c>git diff</c> command provides another way to examine or confirm the changes you have been making.
        Note <em>diff</em> is just short for <em>difference</em>, and is called this because it is used to show differences.
        By default the <c>git diff</c> command will show you any changes that have been made to your local files as compared to the version in the most recent commit in the active branch.
        Run the <c>git diff</c> command now.
      </p>
