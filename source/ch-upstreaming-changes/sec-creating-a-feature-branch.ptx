  <title>Creating a Feature Branch</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      When you set out to make changes to the project you will do so by working on a feature branch.
      <xref ref="fig-create-feature-branch-and-switch" /> illustrates the process of creating a feature branch.
      The activities in this section will walk you through the process of creating a feature branch on which you will fix the issue that you claimed in <xref provisional="a reference back to ch2-issue-tracker section" />.

          Your output should contain the text “Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.”  What do you think it means that your branch is “up to date”?

          Your output should contain the text “nothing to commit, working tree clean.”  What do you think it means that you have “nothing to commit.” Hint: when would you have something to commit?  This is the opposite of that!

  <exercise xml:id="ex-creating-a-branch">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The <c>git branch [name]</c> command creates a new branch with the given <em>name</em>.  When creating a branch, you should give it a short but descriptive name (e.g. <em>FixTypoInReadme</em>).  Note: <em>name</em> may not have spaces, so you can use - (dashes) or CammelCaseText to divide words in your branch names.
      </p>

        <p>
          <p>
            Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name that you will use to fix the issue that you claimed.  Remember not to include the [ ] when writing your own command. Type the command you entered below.

        <p>
          Use the <c>git status</c> command again now. Does creating a new branch with the <c>git branch</c> command make your new branch the active branch?

      </statement>
      <feedback>
        <p>
          <c>git branch [name]</c> only creates the branch.
