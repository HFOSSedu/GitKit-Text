  <title>Switching Branches</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section you learned how to create a branch.
      In this section you will learn more about why branching is important and how to switch between existing branches.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        As you saw in the previous section, the <c>git branch</c> command creates a branch (among other uses), but it does not change your active branch.
        The <c>git switch &lt;name&gt;</c> command switches (i.e.
        changes) the active branch.
      </p>
    </introduction>


    <task xml:id="ex-switching-branches-a" label="ex-switching-branches-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What command will change your active branch to the new feature branch that you created in the previous section?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <response />
    </task>


    <task xml:id="ex-switching-branches-b" label="ex-switching-branches-b">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the <c>git status</c> command again now.
          What part of the output confirms that your feature branch is now the active branch?
        </p>
        <response />
      </statement>
    </task>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Figure <xref ref="fig-switch-to-feature-branch" /> illustrates this idea by showing that you have switched to your feature branch and that your Local Files have not been modified since the last commit on the main branch (drawn in green).

    <introduction>
      <p>
        You can also switch branches using the <c>git branch</c> command.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Issue the <c>git branch</c> command now. You should see a list of branches. How can you tell which branch is the active branch?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <response />

      <statement>
        <p>
          <c>git branch &lt;name&gt;</c> will make <em>name</em> the active branch. Enter a <c>git branch</c> command that will make <c>main</c> the active branch. What command did you enter?

          In the next chapter you will be making changes to your Local Files. It is essential that you are on your feature branch <em>before</em> making any changes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter a <c>git branch</c> command that will make your feature branch the active branch. What command did you enter?
