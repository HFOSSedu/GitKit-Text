    <introduction>
      <p>
        As you saw earlier when looking at the output of <c>git log</c>, each commit has a commit message that briefly describes the changes that are contained in the commit.
        These messages should be concise but meaningful without requiring the reader to refer to the ticket in the issue tracker.
        A future reader of the <c>git log</c> output should be able to obtain an idea of the changes you have made and why you made them by reading your commit messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each of the following issues, order the given commit messages from best (listed first) to worst (listed last).
