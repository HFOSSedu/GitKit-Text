  <exercise xml:id="ex-meaningful-commit-messages" label="ex-meaningful-commit-messages">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        As you saw earlier when looking at the output of <c>git log</c>, each commit has a commit message that briefly describes the changes that are contained in the commit.
        These messages should be concise but meaningful without requiring the reader to refer to the ticket in the issue tracker.
        A future reader of the <c>git log</c> output should be able to obtain an idea of the changes you have made and why you made them by reading your commit messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each of the following issues, order the given commit messages from best (listed first) to worst (listed last).
      </p>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-committing-changes" label="ex-committing-changes">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The <c>git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</c> command commits all of the staged files to the currently active branch with the specified commit message.
        Use the <c>git commit</c> command to commit your staged changes to your local repository with a meaningful commit message.
      </p>
    </introduction>


    <task xml:id="ex-committing-changes-a" label="ex-committing-changes-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Provide the command you entered.

        <response />

    <task xml:id="ex-committing-changes-b" label="ex-committing-changes-b">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now use the <c>git status</c> command again.
          Compare your output to the output in <xref ref="ex-staging-changes-c" />.
          What two changes have occurred that reflect that your changes have been staged? <term>NOTE: like previous question, may want to change this so that it asks which files are staged, untracked, etc.
          Then ask a question like "How do you know your changes have been committed?</term>
        </p>
        <response />

    <task xml:id="ex-committing-changes-c" label="ex-committing-changes-c">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the <c>git log</c> command to show the 3 most recent commits to your branch.
          How is this output different from what you observed in Question #1?  Briefly explain why? <term>Note: Question #1 is now a multiple choice question.
          Maybe there should be multiple choice questions here that are similar (showing that the new commit appears in the log).</term>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Does the output of a <c>git log</c> command now show the information about the commit you made?  Briefly explain why or why not?
