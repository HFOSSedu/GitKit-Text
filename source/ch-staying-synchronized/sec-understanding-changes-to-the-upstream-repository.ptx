  <title>Understanding Changes to the Upstream Repository</title>

  <p>
    If the upstream maintainers decide that the changes in your PR are good for the project, they will merge them into the upstream <c>main</c> branch.
    That way they become a part of the main project, and everyone can benefit from your work.
    In class your instructor played the role of an upstream maintainer and demonstrated how the changes contained in pull requests are merged.

    GitHub will inform you when the active branch in your origin repo is out of synch with the upstream.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use your browser to visit your origin repo on GitHub and ensure that the <c>main</c> branch is selected.
    Find the part of the page that indicates that your <c>main</c> branch is <em>behind</em> (i.e.
    not the same as, or out of synch with) the upstream <c>main</c>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not see a message that your main branch is behind the upstream <c>main</c> branch go to <xref ref="sec-appendix-a-staying-synchronized" /> of this chapter and follow the instructions there.
    Once you complete <xref ref="sec-appendix-a-staying-synchronized" />, return to this question.
