  <title>Understanding Changes to the Upstream Repository</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      If the upstream maintainers decide that the changes in your PR (pull request) are good for the project, they will merge them into the upstream <c>main</c> branch.
      That way they become a part of the main project, and everyone can benefit from your work.
      In class your instructor played the role of a maintainer and demonstrated how the changes contained in pull requests are merged into the upstream. <xref ref="fig-changes-merged-into-upstream" /> shows the upstream with several new changes merged into it's <c>main</c> branch.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          At this point the upstream <c>main</c> branch should have changes that are not contained in your origin and local <c>main</c> branches. That is, you <alert>are out of synch</alert> with the upstream.
        
          When your origin repository is out of synch with the upstream, GitHub will display a message that informs you.  Let's investigate this message.
        </p>
      </introduction>


      <task xml:id="ex-origin-main-behind-main-a" label="ex-origin-main-behind-main-a">

          </p>
          <p>
            Which of the following messages do you see that indicates that your origin's main branch is behind the upstream <c>main</c>?

            <feedback>
              <p>
                Correct! Being behind means that the upstream <c>main</c> branch contains changes that your origin <c>main</c> branch does not.

            <feedback>

                Being ahead means that your origin <c>main</c> branch contains changes that are not in the upstream <c>main</c> branch. However, right now your origin <c>main</c> should be behind the upstream <c>main</c> branch.

                Seeing no message indicates that origin <c>main</c> branch is up to date with (i.e. identical to) the upstream <c>main</c> branch.
