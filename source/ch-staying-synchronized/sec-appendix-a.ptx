      The information in this appendix is only important if you were directed here from <xref ref="ex-origin-main-behind-main" />, otherwise it may be ignored.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <p>
    You found in <xref ref="ex-origin-main-behind-main" /> that the <c>main</c> branch in your origin repository was not behind the <c>main</c> branch in the upstream repository.
    This would have happened if you created your fork and clone after the instructor merged the class pull requests for the Round 1 issues.
    You can recover from this situation using the commands below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ensure that you are in the <em>GitKit-FarmData2</em> directory then use the following commands:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <c>git switch main</c>
      </li>

      <li>
        <c>git reset --hard 96d9ecee396a8a6b4bda3b2c787deeec6c353217</c>
      </li>

      <li>
        <c>git push --force origin main</c>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      You should now return to <xref ref="ex-origin-main-behind-main" /> and the <c>main</c> branch in your origin should now be behind the <c>main</c> branch in the upstream.
    </p>
