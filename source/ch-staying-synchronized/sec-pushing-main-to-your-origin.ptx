  <title>Pushing <c>main</c> to Your Origin</title>

  <exercises>
    <title />
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your local <c>main</c> branch is now in synch with the upstream <c>main</c> branch. However, the updates that you pulled into your local <c>main</c> branch are not yet in your origin repository. The exercises in this section will guide you the process of getting them there.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall that you previously used the
          <c> git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; </c>
          command to push your feature branch from your local repo to your origin repo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give a <c>git push</c> command that will push the <c>main</c> branch of your local repo to your remote <c>origin</c> repo.

          Please give the full <c>git push</c> command using the format indicated in the question.
          Be sure not to leave in the &lt; and &gt; symbols.
          Replace the words remote and branch with the appropriate names.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Run the <c>git push</c> command you wrote in <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> in the Terminal and examine the output.
        </p>

        <statement>
        <p>
          Examine the output from your <c>git push</c> command.
          You should see a lot of information about <em>deltas</em> and <em>objects</em>. Those are terms related to the inner workings of Git that we will not worry about.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't see information about deltas and objects but see an error message instead, revisit <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> and try again.

  <p>
    As with most things related to Git and GitHub, there are a number of different ways to synchronize.
    For example, you can also fetch the changes from the upstream main to your origin and then pull them from there to your local repository.
