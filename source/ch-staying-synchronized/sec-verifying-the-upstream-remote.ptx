  <title>The Upstream Remote</title>

  <introduction >
    <p>
      Before you will be able to pull changes from the upstream your local repository will need to know where to find the upstream repository.
      In earlier figures (e.g. <xref ref="fig-changes-merged-into-upstream" />), there were dotted orange lines indicating that your local repository knew about your origin and that your origin knew about the upstream.
      However, there was no orange dotted line from your local repository to the upstream. That is because, by default, your local repository does not know the location of the upstream repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig-synching-with-upstream" /> a dotted orange line was added pointing from your local repository to the upstream. Git needs to have this information so that it can pull changes from the upstream into your local repository. In this section, you will see that the <term>upstream remote</term> provides this information.

    <title>Understanding Remotes</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A <term>remote</term> is a repository that is stored on GitHub, or another repository hosting sited.
      </p> 
      <p>
        A <term>Git remote</term> is the URL of a <term>remote</term> and an associated name (e.g. origin, upstream). Git uses Git remotes to locate remote repositories.  Though it can be confusing, the <term>remote</term> is also commonly used as a synonym for <term>Git remote</term>.

    <title>Adding an Upstream Remote</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        As you saw in <xref ref="topic-understanding-remotes" /> your local repository contains an upstream remote that points to the upstream being used for your course.  This upstream was set automatically by the development environment when you opened your local repository.     
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all development environments are able to automatically set the upstream remote when you open your local repository.  The exercises in this section will walk you through how you can manually set the upstream remote if you need to.
      </p>
    </introduction>

          The format for this command is: <c>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</c>

        <p>
          The URL of the upstream for your class was given by your instructor and should be in <xref ref="ex-upstream-url" />.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>
      
    </exercises>

    <p>
      Note that if you are using a development environment that does not automatically set the upstream remote for you, you will still only need to set it once.  Once the upstream remote is set for a repository you will be able to pull from the upstream repo as often as is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also worth mention that there is nothing particularly special about the names of the remotes. The names origin and upstream are used by convention by most developers.  However, you could name your remotes anything you like and they would still work.
