    In order to pull changes from the upstream you will need to tell your local repository where the upstream is.
    In earlier figures, dotted orange lines were used to indicate that your local repository knew about the origin and that the origin knew about the upstream.
    But there was no orange dotted line from your local repository to the upstream.
    That is because, by default, your local repository isn’t aware of the upstream.

    <title> In order to pull from the upstream you will first need to make your local repository aware of the upstream. This is done by setting a remote for it.  This question will walk you through that process </title>

          The <c>git remote -v</c> command lists the names and URLs of all of the remote repositories (or just remotes for short) that your local repo knows about.
          Run this command in the directory that contains your local repository.

          How is the origin remote indicated in part a represented in <xref ref="fig-changes-merged-into-upstream" />?

        <p>
          To create a new remote that tells your local repo about the upstream you will need the URL of the upstream repo.
          Use your browser to navigate to the upstream <em>FarmData2</em> repo that you are using for this course and give its URL here.
          Hint: You can find the upstream using the link from your origin repo in GitHub.
          Once you find the upstream, you can get the URL by using the “Code” button in the upstream repo, it ends in <c>.git</c>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
  </exercise>
  The <c>git remote</c> command can also be used to add a new remote to your local repo.
  The format for this command is: <c>git remote add <remote repo name> <remote repo URL> </c> Use the above command to create a remote named <em>upstream</em> that points to the <em>FarmData2 upstream</em> repository that you are using for this activity.
