  <title>Overview of Synchronizing with the Upstream Repository</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As you saw in <xref ref="topic-understanding-changes-to-the-upstream-repository" />, as changes from pull requests (yours and others) are merged into upstream <c>main</c>, the <c>main</c> branches in your local and origin repos will get <em>out of synch with the upstream</em>.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <p>
    Now, recall that upstream <c>main</c> should be the starting point for all new work.
    So, before you can work on something new, you'll need to ensure that your <c>main</c> branches look like the upstream <c>main</c> (i.e.
    you will synchronize them with the upstream).
    This is a two-step process.
    First, you will <term>pull</term> the upstream <c>main</c> into your local repository and then you will <term>push</term> it to your origin.
    <xref ref="fig-synching-with-upstream" /> shows how pulling <c>main</c> from the upstream and then pushing it to your origin synchronizes the <c>main</c> branches.
