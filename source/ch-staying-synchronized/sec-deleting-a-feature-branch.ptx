  <title>Deleting a Feature Branch</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Once your changes have been merged into the upstream <c>main</c>, and you have synchronized there is no need for you to retain your feature branch.
      There is no harm in keeping it.
      But most developers will delete them to avoid having their repos become cluttered with old feature branches.

          It is not possible to delete the active branch.
          So, if you have not already, switch from your feature branch to the <c>main</c> branch.
