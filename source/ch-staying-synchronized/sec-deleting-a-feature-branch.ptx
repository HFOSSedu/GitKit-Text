  <title>Deleting a Feature Branch</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Once your changes have been merged into the upstream <c>main</c>, and you have synchronized, there is no need for you to retain your feature branch.
      There is no harm in keeping it.
      But most developers will delete them to avoid having their repos become cluttered with old feature branches.
    </p>

    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-deleting-feature-branch"/> shows the state that will result after deleting the feature branch from your local and origin repositories.

      Deleting a feature branch is a two step process, first you will delete the feature branch from your local repository.  Then you will push that deletion from your local branch to your origin, in order to delete it there as well.

    <title>Deleting a Feature Branch from your Local Repo</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        The first step in deleting a feature branch is to delete the feature branch from your local repository.
        The exercises in this section will walk you through that process.

              Git will not allow you to delete the active branch. So typically you will switch to the <c>main</c> branch before deleting a feature branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Choose and order the commands below to switch from your feature branch to the <c>main</c> branch and then list all of the branches in your local repository.
              Not all commands will be used.
