  <title>Let's Do it Again</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      You’ve learned a lot about Git and GitHub.
      But, to become proficient with these tools takes a lot of repetition and practice.
      This section asks you to go through the process of finding an issue, fixing it and creating a pull request again.
      This is good practice but what you will be asked to do has also been carefully planned to set us up for the next chapter too!

        The issue tracker in the upstream FarmData2 repository being used for these tasks.

    <task xml:id="ex-claim-issue-a" label="ex-claim-issue-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the label dropdown in the issue tracker to filter for issues labeled with the “Round2” tag.
          How many issues are tagged with this label?

        <p>
          Clearly there are not enough “Round2” issues for everyone to have their own as was the case with the “Round1” issues.
          So, this time there will be multiple people working on the same issue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pick one of the “Round2” issues to work on and make a comment on it to indicate your interest in working on it.
          Note it is not necessary that the issue be assigned to you this time.
          Try to spread out across the issues so that multiple people have commented that they are working on each one.
          Give the Issue # and title that you chose.

        Now you will go through the process of fixing the issue and making a pull request.
        You will use the same process that you used for your “Round1” issue earlier.
        That process had a number of steps.
        They are listed below in a jumbled-up order, determine the proper order.
