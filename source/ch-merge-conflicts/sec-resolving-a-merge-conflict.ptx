  <title>Resolving a Merge Conflict</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-resolving-merge-conflict" /> shows the <c>main</c> branch has committed changes that conflict with what the local branch wants to commit.

      This section will walk you through the process of resolving the merge conflict using a graphical merge tool.  The flow of this process is illustrated in Figure 3.  You will switch to your feature branch, perform the merge, use the graphical merge tool to resolve the resulting conflict, and then stage and commit the merged content.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Ensure that you are on your feature branch.  Then issue the command to merge the <c>main</c> branch into your feature branch (like you did in <xref ref="ex-merge-main-branch" />).  The merge should once again fail because of the conflict.  Use the <c>cat</c> command to confirm that the raw merge conflict information now appears in the conflicted file again.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      As you have seen when a merge fails <c>git</c> places the raw merge conflict information into the conflicted files.  You could simply edit that file to resolve the merge conflict.  However, in practice it is usually easier to use a <em>mergetool</em>.

          When using the merge tool, you resolve conflicts by modifying the Result pane so that it appears as desired. You can use the point-and-click "Accept ..." and "Remove ..." options provided by the merge tool to move content into or out of the Result pane or you can edit the Result pane directly.

          Use the merge tool to resolve the conflict so that the Result contains:

              your changes where there is a conflict.
