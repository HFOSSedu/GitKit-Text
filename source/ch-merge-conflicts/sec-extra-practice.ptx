          To do the extra practice you'll need to have your development environment running.

        <p>
          Please be patient as this can take a few minutes.  When the development environment is ready you will see the message "Kit development environment is ready for use." and your browser window will look similar to the following:

          The upstream repository contains a branch created just for this extra practice. This branch was created so that it contains some pre-made conflicts with the upstream <c>main</c> branch.

      <statement>
        <p>
          At this point you should think of the <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch as a feature branch that you created from your <c>main</c> and then made some changes that resulted in conflicts with the upstream <c>main</c> branch. Thinking of the <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch this way leaves you at the point where you are trying to merge the modified upstream <c>main</c> into your feature branch as you did in <xref ref="topic-git-merge-command" />).

          The <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch contains a few conflicts so the merge you attempted in <xref ref="ex-extra-practice-merging-active-branch" /> should fail.  Resolve the conflicts by accepting the changes from the <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch.
