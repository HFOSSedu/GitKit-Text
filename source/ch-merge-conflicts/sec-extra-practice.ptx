      <statement>
        <p>
          The upstream repository contains a branch created just for this practice. Use the following command to get this feature branch from the upstream into your local repo:
          <ul marker="">
            <li>
              <p>
                <c>git fetch upstream merge-conflict-practice</c>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch was created so that it contains some conflicts with the upstream <c>main</c> branch.  When you have fetched this branch, think of it as if you had created it from <c>main</c>, then made some changes that resulted in conflicts with the upstream <c>main</c> branch.  This leaves you at the point where you are trying to merge main into this feature branch and resolve the conflicts (e.g. like in <xref ref="fig-resolving-merge-conflict" />).

          Make the <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch active and try to merge <c>main</c> into it.  Give the commands that you used and their output here.

    <exercise xml:id="ex-extra-practice-merging-resolve-conflicts" label="ex-extra-practice-merging-resolve-conflicts">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <c>merge-conflict-practice</c> branch contains a few conflicts so the merge you attempted in <xref ref="ex-extra-practice-merging-active-branch" /> should fail.  Resolve the conflicts by accepting the changes from the merge-conflict-practice branch and all of the non-conflicting changes from the main branch.
