  <title>Updating Your Pull Request</title>

  <introduction>
 		<p>
      At this point you have resolved the merge conflict on the feature branch in your local repository.  What is left is to push that branch to your <c>origin</c>.  When you do so, GitHub will automatically update your pull request to the <c>upstream</c> for that branch.
    </p>
